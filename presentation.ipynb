The idea behind this architecture is based on the assumption that the outcome of a match between two teams depends significantly on their current form. The form of a team can be viewed as its recent sequence of results versus other teams. So if the same model that was designed as a baseline (i.e. the MLP) is given an extra context about the form of the two teams facing each other, we could hopefully improve the baseline. The task of encoding the form of both teams is taken care by the RNN.\n",

    "More in detail, the network is fed with the data of the match whose outcome we want to predict, plus the sequence of the last 5 games played by both teams. From the two historical sequences, the 2-layers RNN should encode the form of both teams. The result is then combined with the pre-match data and fed to the MLP which outputs a result.\n",

    "Moreover, as mentioned at the beginning, experiments with feature selection were made in an effort to improve the performances of the hybrid and rnn models. Note that the high dimensionality of the dataset is mostly due to the one-hot encoding of players, coaches, referees and teams. Therefore, two additional models were trained without those features. This was done based on the assumption that knowing for example the name of the two teams facing each other does not make a greater contribution to the prediction of the outcome if the network already knows that the home team is in much better form with respect to the away team. On the contrary, some players are game changers and knowing they are going to participate in a match is important. Also, when a team is assigned a new coach, it usually does not perform well in the following matches. Despite this, the aforementioned features were still discarded to see if they mostly bring noise.\n",
