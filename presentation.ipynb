    "The hybrid model consists of a RNN followed by a MLP. The idea behind this architecture is based on the assumption that the outcomes of a match between two teams depends significantly on their current form. The form of a team can be viewed as their recent sequence of results versus the other teams. So if the model (i.e. MLP) is given extra context about the form of the two teams prior to the match of which we want to predict the outcome, we could possibly improve the baseline. The task of encoding the form of both teams is taken care by the RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "More in detail, the network is fed with the data of the match whose outcome we want to predict plus the sequence of the last 5 games played by its home and away team. From the sequence of the 5 matches, the RNN encodes the form of both teams and passes its result to the MLP which in turn adds this extra context to the data of the match and outputs the result.\n",
