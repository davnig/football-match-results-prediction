# Football match results prediction

The aim of this project is to develop and compare simple Deep Learning models with the ultimate goal of trying to
predict the outcome of *Seria A* football matches, i.e. **home win**, **away win** or **draw**.
In total, three models were designed, referenced as:

- **Baseline**
- **Hybrid**
- **RNN**

Details about the dataset, the implementation, the training and the results can be found in
the [presentation notebook](presentation.ipynb).
